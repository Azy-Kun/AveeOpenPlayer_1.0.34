The Atom (XML-based) Web content and metadata syndication format.
{@link christophedelory.atom.Feed Atom} is an XML-based document format that describes lists of related information known as "feeds".
Feeds are composed of a number of items, known as "entries", each with an extensible set of attached metadata.
For example, each entry has a title.
<br>
The primary use case that Atom addresses is the syndication of Web content such as weblogs and news headlines to Web sites as well as directly to user agents.
